## 🧠 Psychotherapist Chatbot

This project implements an **AI-powered Psychotherapist Chatbot** designed to simulate supportive, therapeutic-style conversations using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The chatbot aims to provide empathetic responses, emotional support, and basic mental-health-oriented dialogue in a safe and controlled manner.

The system processes user input, understands emotional and contextual cues, and generates appropriate responses that follow a psychotherapy-inspired conversational approach. While it is **not a replacement for professional mental health care**, it demonstrates how AI can be used to assist, guide, and support users through conversational interaction.

### ✨ Key Features

* NLP-based text preprocessing and understanding
* Context-aware conversational responses
* Emotionally supportive and empathetic dialogue generation
* Interactive chatbot interface implemented in Python
* Modular and extensible design for future improvements

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK / spaCy / Transformers – depending on your implementation)
* Machine Learning / Deep Learning models
* Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation

### 🎯 Project Objectives

* Demonstrate the application of NLP in conversational AI
* Explore AI-assisted mental health support systems
* Build an educational prototype for research and learning purposes

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This chatbot is intended **for educational and experimental purposes only**. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Users experiencing mental health issues should seek help from qualified professionals.
